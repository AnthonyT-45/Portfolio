            <h3>Rats!</h3>
            <p>
              "Rats!" is a 2D roguelike adventure game developed in Unity, where
              the player goes on a journey as a chef determined to reclaim his
              stolen ingredients from a mischievous horde of rats. Set within an
              urban sewer system, the game blends fast-paced combat with
              strategic exploration, offering a fresh experience with every
              playthrough. This project is a current work in progress and will
              be released on Steam soon.

            <h3>Python Regression Models</h3>
            <p>
              A machine learning project where I analyzed a salary dataset to
              predict employee salaries based on a variety of factors such as
              gender, job position, country, and race. This project involved
              data preprocessing, feature engineering with polynomial
              transformations, and the implementation of both Linear and Ridge
              regression models. The model performance was evalutated by using
              metrics such as mean squared error and r-squared.

            <p>
              A console-based task scheduler application in C# that enables
              users to create an account and manage their tasks in an organized
              manner. Features within this application include creating,
              viewing, and deleting tasks. With these tasks you can create
              customizable priorities, deadlines with automated reminders, and
              tags to associate with tasks. This project utilizes
              object-oriented programming in order for the code structure to be
              scalable and maintainable in this application's design.

              players to have to carefully move around the map and strategize
              how to care for the enemies to reach the goal. Overall, this game
              is unique in its design for caring for enemies rather than
              defeating them.
